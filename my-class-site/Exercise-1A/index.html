        <i>This article is about the fruit. For other uses, see Lemon (disambiguation).<br>

        Not to be confused with Lemon.</i>
        <br>
        <p> The lemon <i>(Citrus X limon)</i> is a species of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, 
            native to Asia, primarily Northeast India (Assam), Northern Myanmar, or China</p>

        <p>The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice,
             which has both culinary and cleaning uses.<sup>[2]</sup> The pulp and rind are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is 
             about 5-6% citric acid,<sup>[citation needed] </sup>
             with a pH of around 2.2,<sup>[3]</sup> giving it a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice, derived from the citric acid, makes it a 
             key ingredient in drinks and foods <sup>[4]</sup> such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie</p>

     <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
        <i>See also: Citron ยง Origin and distribution</i>
        <p>The origin of the lemon is unknown, though lemons are thought to have first grown in Assam (a region in northeast India), northern Myanmar, 
            or China. <sup>[2][failed verification]</sup> A genomic study of the lemon indicated it was a hybrid between bitter orange (sour orange) and citron.<sup>[5][6]</sup></p>
        <p>Lemons are supposed to have entered Europe near southern Italy no later than the second century AD, during the time of Ancient Rome.
            <sup>[2]</sup> They were later introduced to Persia and then to Iraq and Egypt around 700 AD.
            <sup>[2]</sup> The lemon was first recorded in literature in a 10th-century Arabic treatise on farming and was also used as an ornamental plant in early Islamic gardens.
            <sup>[2]</sup> It was distributed widely throughout the Arab world and the Mediterranean region between 1000 and 1150. <sup>[2]</sup> An article on Lemon and lime tree cultivation in Andalusia, Spain, is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, 
            Book on Agriculture.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
